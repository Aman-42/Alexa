# AI Assistant Alexa using Python

## Project Overview
This project is a Python-based AI assistant inspired by Amazon's Alexa. It is designed to perform various tasks such as answering questions, playing music, setting reminders, providing weather updates, and more. The assistant leverages Python libraries for speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and API integrations to deliver a seamless user experience.

---

## Features
- **Voice Commands**: Interact with the assistant using voice commands.
- **Task Automation**: Perform tasks like setting reminders, playing music, and searching the web.
- **API Integrations**: Fetch real-time data (e.g., weather, news) using APIs.
- **Customizable**: Easily extend the assistant's functionality by adding new features.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **SpeechRecognition**: For converting speech to text.
- **pyttsx3**: For text-to-speech conversion.
- **APIs**: 
  - OpenWeatherMap API (for weather updates).
  - Wikipedia API (for information retrieval).
- **Other Libraries**: `datetime`, `webbrowser`, `os`, etc.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- An API key for OpenWeatherMap (optional, for weather updates).

### Steps to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-assistant-alexa.git
   cd ai-assistant-alexa
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up API Keys**:
   - If using the OpenWeatherMap API, create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your API key:
     ```plaintext
     WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

4. **Run the Assistant**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Start the assistant by running `main.py`.
2. Speak into your microphone when prompted.
3. Use commands like:
   - "What's the weather today?"
   - "Play some music."
   - "Set a reminder for 5 PM."
   - "Tell me a joke."
